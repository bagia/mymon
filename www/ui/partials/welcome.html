    <h3>Welcome {{user.name}}</h3>
    <p>This site provides you with a way to monitor your Facebook profile.
        Whilst there is no way to obtain a detailed list of who is browsing
        your profile, you can set up a <i>watchdog</i> to receive an alert
        when a specific person in your friend list is visiting your page.
        This website will help to deploy counters to monitor :
        <ul>
            <li>how many visits your page received, from your friends or from anyone you may or may not know (including search engines),</li>
            <li>how many of these visits actually were from your friends and not from search engines or strangers,</li>
            <li>if a specific friend is visiting your profile.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
