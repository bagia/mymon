My Monitor
======

My Monitor provides you with a way to monitor your Facebook profile. 

You can do this by setting up "watchdogs" to receive an alert when a specific person in your friend list is visiting your page. This website will help to deploy these watchdogs :
- in a way that will allow you to track a single person or a group of person
- in a way that will allow you to track - almost - your entire friend-list
- in a way that could tell you whether a visit was made by someone in your friend-list or someone else (search engine, friend of friend, etc.)
