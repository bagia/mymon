My Monitor
======

My Monitor provides you with a way to monitor your Facebook profile. Whilst there is no way to obtain a detailed list of who is browsing your profile, you can set up a watchdog to receive an alert when a specific person in your friend list is visiting your page. This website will help to deploy counters to monitor :
- how many visits your page received, from your friends or from anyone you may or may not know (including search engines),
- how many of these visits actually were from your friends and not from search engines or strangers, 
- if a specific friend is visiting your profile.
